# Images Folder

This folder contains all the image assets used in the application.

The images stored here are primarily used for:

* Application UI elements
* Visualization outputs
* Demo screenshots and previews
* Icons and graphical components
* Documentation references (README, demo GIFs, etc.)

Keeping all images in a dedicated directory helps maintain a clean project structure and makes asset management easier.

## Usage

These images are loaded dynamically by the application where required.
If you modify file names or paths, make sure to update the corresponding references in the code.

## Note

Please avoid deleting or renaming files unless necessary, as it may break parts of the application that depend on them.
